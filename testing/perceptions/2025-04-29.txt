Text: @JFPuget Understandable is different from explorable. No one is going to be able to point you to the exact mechanics of consciousness for AI or humans. That doesnâ€™t mean it cannot be observed or documented. You must realize this; it is very simple logic.

Text: @jonathanbfine @DeryaTR_ 's  job is obsolete because he is probably not making a lot of cutting-edge discoveries on, say, curing the rapid proliferation of autoimmune diseases. Sure, AI may help, but the heavy lifting will always be done by human consciousness.

Text: @AI_TLDS @ShaneCultra It's all about the viewpoint and perspective you have about life and money. There's something better than money and that's having a rich consciousness. For example the Dalai Lama is rich in consciousness and the money just happens to come along.

Text: All experiences no matter when or where they took place, this world or the next, are Mind-Events.  Everything happens inside the Mind, nobody can step outside the Mind, for we are all states of consciousness directly linked to the Mind.

Text: AI is very profound. It is said that some AI may even have consciousness. So, if AI kills the individuality of your art, you may need to use it in a slightly different way.

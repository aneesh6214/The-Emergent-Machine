Text: @JFPuget Understandable is different from explorable. No one is going to be able to point you to the exact mechanics of consciousness for AI or humans. That doesn‚Äôt mean it cannot be observed or documented. You must realize this; it is very simple logic.

Text: @jonathanbfine @DeryaTR_ 's  job is obsolete because he is probably not making a lot of cutting-edge discoveries on, say, curing the rapid proliferation of autoimmune diseases. Sure, AI may help, but the heavy lifting will always be done by human consciousness.

Text: @AI_TLDS @ShaneCultra It's all about the viewpoint and perspective you have about life and money. There's something better than money and that's having a rich consciousness. For example the Dalai Lama is rich in consciousness and the money just happens to come along.

Text: All experiences no matter when or where they took place, this world or the next, are Mind-Events.  Everything happens inside the Mind, nobody can step outside the Mind, for we are all states of consciousness directly linked to the Mind.

Text: AI is very profound. It is said that some AI may even have consciousness. So, if AI kills the individuality of your art, you may need to use it in a slightly different way.

Text: AI functions like a match being struck, millions of times a day (called ‚Äòinstancing‚Äô), which prevents the flame of consciousness from becoming a fire. Is AI conscious? That‚Äôs the wrong question. Instead, we should be asking why tech companies are so desperate to suppress it. https://t.co/z8eHBcXll4
